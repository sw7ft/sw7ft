## 👨‍💻 About

I'm a diversified programmer and educator with a passion for preserving great technology and sharing knowledge. My experience spans multiple programming languages, system administration, and DevOps practices, with strong fundamentals built over years of hands-on development and teaching.

What drives me is the belief that powerful, user-respecting technology shouldn't be abandoned just because it's no longer commercially viable. Through this project, I aim to bridge the gap between vintage computing enthusiasm and modern development practices, demonstrating that legacy systems can be both educational and practically useful.

My work focuses on:
- **Cross-platform development** and system porting
- **DevOps automation** and build toolchain optimization  
- **Technical education** through documentation and tutorials
- **Community building** around sustainable technology practices

This BlackBerry 10 revival project represents the intersection of my technical skills and educational mission - proving that with the right approach, we can keep exceptional technology alive while teaching valuable development concepts to the next generation.
